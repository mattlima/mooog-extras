# Mooog Extras

## Additional Mooog nodes

> Version 0.1

A collection of additional nodes for [Mooog](https://github.com/mattlima/mooog). This
is my personal working collection so I make no guarantees about suitability or code 
functionality.


## Getting started

Include the source file for the node you want after mooog.js, then use them like any other
via the `node()` function.

## Install via bower

bower install mooog-extras
